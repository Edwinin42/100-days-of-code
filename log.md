FreeCodeCamp
"You have completed 71 of 1409 coding challenges.

You have built 0 out of 30 projects.

You have earned 0 out of 6 certifications."

**Thoughts** Second day! Now it is more than just a one of hour! My streak begins. CSS is pretty cool, I am starting to get a feel for what its like to write code, CSS is more rewarding/interesting for me than HTML.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
